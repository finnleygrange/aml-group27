# ADR-5: Implementing a Mobile-Responsive View for Web Application

## Status
Proposed

## Context
With the growing trend of users accessing applications on mobile devices, it's crucial to ensure that our application is mobile-friendly. Our project needs to support responsive design, ensuring an optimal user experience across different devices, especially on smaller screens like smartphones.

### The key considerations are:

-Ensuring the layout adapts to both mobile devices (small screens) and desktops (larger screens).
-Delivering a user-friendly interface on all screen sizes without compromising functionality.
-Minimizing development time by leveraging existing web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

### The alternatives considered include:
-Mobile-first responsive design (preferred): Start with a design optimized for small screens and then enhance it for larger screens using CSS media queries.
-Desktop-first design: Design the site primarily for desktop and then adjust for mobile using media queries (which may lead to more complex code).
-Separate mobile and desktop websites: Create distinct layouts for mobile and desktop, resulting in increased maintenance and complexity.

## Decision
We will implement a mobile-first responsive design using CSS Flexbox and media queries. This decision is based on the following reasons:

-User-Centric Design: A large portion of users access websites on mobile devices, so prioritizing mobile users improves user experience.
-Efficiency: Mobile-first design encourages better performance on smaller screens and reduces the need for excessive styles for larger screens.
-Maintainability: It's easier to scale up the design from a mobile-friendly base rather than adapting a desktop-heavy layout.
-Performance: By designing with mobile devices in mind first, we can optimize images, fonts, and layouts to ensure faster loading times, especially on mobile networks.

## Implementation Approach:
-Flexbox and Grid Layouts: Use Flexbox for flexible item layouts and CSS Grid for more complex grid-based designs, which will easily adapt to various screen sizes.
-CSS Media Queries: Implement media queries to adjust the layout based on the screen size. For example, the layout will stack vertically on mobile devices and display horizontally on larger screens.
-Touch-Friendly UI: Ensure buttons, links, and other interactive elements are large enough for mobile users to interact with comfortably.
-Test Responsiveness: Ensure that content, such as images and tables, resize appropriately on small screens without causing horizontal scrolling.

## Consequences
-Mobile Experience: Since weâ€™re prioritizing mobile design, mobile users will have a highly optimized experience, with elements that scale and adapt to small screens.
-Desktop Experience: As the layout adapts, users on desktop and larger devices will also have a pleasant experience with appropriately spaced content and enhanced visibility.
-Performance: We will need to test and optimize images and assets to ensure they load efficiently on mobile networks.
-Testing Complexity: We will need to perform extensive testing across multiple devices (both Android and iOS) and screen sizes to ensure the design works across all platforms.


## Alternatives Considered
- Desktop-first design: Starting with desktop-first design and using media queries to adapt to mobile, which could have added unnecessary complexity and more effort in scaling the design for mobile.
-Separate mobile and desktop websites: This would increase development and maintenance time, as well as lead to potential issues with keeping content consistent across two platforms.
