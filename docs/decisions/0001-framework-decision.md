# Selecting a Frontend Framework for AML System  

## Context and Problem Statement  

The Advanced Media Library (AML) system requires a frontend framework to deliver an accessible and responsive user interface across web and mobile platforms. The system will serve diverse users, including library members, librarians, branch managers, and administrators, each with specific needs, such as:  
- Accessible navigation for visually impaired users (e.g., screen reader support).  
- Real-time updates for media availability and transactions.  
- Multi-device compatibility (desktop, tablets, and mobile devices).  

The chosen framework must enable AML to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience while ensuring maintainability and scalability. It should support features like dynamic content rendering, efficient state management, and compliance with WCAG 2 accessibility standards.  

## Decision Drivers  

1. **Performance**: Ensure a fast and smooth user experience, even under high load.  
2. **Accessibility**: Meet WCAG 2 standards for inclusive design.  
3. **Scalability**: Support the growing user base and increasing complexity of AML’s services.  
4. **Developer Productivity**: Provide strong tooling, a robust ecosystem, and ease of development.  
5. **Community and Support**: Offer a strong developer community and long-term viability.  

## Considered Options  

1. **React.js**  
2. **Vue.js**  
3. **Angular**  

## Decision Outcome  

### Chosen Option: **React.js**  

React.js was selected for its balance of performance, flexibility, and a strong ecosystem. Its component-based architecture and state management libraries (like Redux or React Context) are well-suited for AML’s dynamic and interactive interfaces.  

#### Key Reasons for Selection  
- **Performance:** React’s virtual DOM ensures efficient rendering, making it suitable for AML’s real-time updates and large data interactions.  
- **Accessibility:** Extensive support for ARIA roles and accessible design patterns helps ensure WCAG 2 compliance.  
- **Scalability:** React’s modular architecture allows easy scaling as AML’s requirements grow.  
- **Developer Productivity:** The ecosystem includes mature tools like React Developer Tools, React Query, and a variety of state management libraries.  
- **Community and Longevity:** React has a large and active developer community, with strong backing from Meta, ensuring long-term support and updates.  

### Rejected Options  

#### **Vue.js**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Simpler learning curve compared to React or Angular.  
  - Flexible design that blends well with existing libraries.  
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Smaller ecosystem and less tooling compared to React.  
  - Limited adoption in large-scale enterprise projects, raising concerns about long-term scalability for AML’s requirements.  

#### **Angular**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Comprehensive framework with built-in features for state management, dependency injection, and routing.  
  - Strong support for enterprise-level applications.  
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Steeper learning curve, which could increase onboarding time for developers.  
  - Higher complexity for smaller or mid-sized projects like AML’s PoC.  

## Consequences  

### Positive Outcomes  
- **Improved User Experience:** Fast rendering and responsive UI enhance usability across web and mobile platforms.  
- **Developer Efficiency:** Component-based design promotes code reuse and reduces development time.  
- **Future-Proofing:** React’s popularity ensures continuous updates and a steady talent pool.  

### Negative Outcomes  
- **Learning Curve:** While familiar to most developers, new team members may require onboarding to understand React’s advanced concepts like hooks and state management.  
- **Ecosystem Choices:** The abundance of libraries for routing, state management, and testing can be overwhelming for newcomers.  

## Confirmation  

The decision will be validated through:  
1. **Proof-of-Concept (PoC):**  
   - Building a user interface for key functionalities like media search, borrowing, and notifications.  
   - Testing responsiveness and accessibility with tools like Lighthouse and Axe.  
2. **User Testing:**  
   - Collecting feedback from representative users, including visually impaired personas, to ensure accessibility and usability.  
3. **Performance Benchmarks:**  
   - Measuring rendering and load times under simulated high-traffic conditions.  

## Pros and Cons of the Options  

### React.js  
**Pros:**  
- Component-based architecture promotes reusability and modular design.  
- Mature ecosystem with a wide variety of libraries and tools.  
- Strong community support and long-term viability.  

**Cons:**  
- Requires integrating third-party libraries for state management and routing.  
- Overhead for managing ecosystem choices.  

### Vue.js  
**Pros:**  
- Intuitive syntax and simpler learning curve.  
- Excellent for projects needing lightweight solutions.  

**Cons:**  
- Limited scalability for large enterprise applications.  
- Smaller community compared to React or Angular.  

### Angular  
**Pros:**  
- All-in-one framework with built-in features.  
- Well-suited for enterprise-grade applications.  

**Cons:**  
- Steep learning curve and higher development overhead.  
- Less flexibility for integrating external libraries compared to React.  

## More Information  

React will be reassessed after the PoC to validate its suitability for AML’s long-term needs. Feedback from accessibility testing and user feedback sessions will guide any future refinements to the framework selection.
